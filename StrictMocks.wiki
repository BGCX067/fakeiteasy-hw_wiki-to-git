#summary On how to create strict mocks in FakeItEasy.

= Introduction =

FakeItEasy is slightly opinionated in this regard and I think that strict mocks should be avoided as far as possible. There is however an easy way to achieve strict mock behaviour.


= Details =

{{{
var foo = A.Fake<IFoo>();
Any.CallTo(foo).Throws(new Exception("An unexpected method was called on the fake object."));
}}}

After you have configured your fake in this fashion you can configure any "allowed" calls as usual, for example:

{{{
A.CallTo(() => foo.Bar()).Returns("bar");
}}}
